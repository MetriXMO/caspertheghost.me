            GIMO is an International Mathematical Olympiad Style mathematical contest held online
            for individuals. It is similar to the IMO format except that here the contest will be individual based rather than team based and it will be untimed.
            You will be given nearly twelve days to work out with six problems and you have to submit them within that time interval. 
           
          </p>
                   
          <p>
       In case you are confused with the format: </p>
          <br></br>
<p> Each problem is worth 7 points so you can score at most 42 points. Please use wisely the time we gave to workout with the problems.
  Contest Format is individual and <b>detailed schedule</b> is provided below and on the PDF. </p>
          <p>Submission Process</p><br></br>
          
          <p> 
            <b>Submission Process I.</b> You can submit your solutions on AoPS PM to <b className="max-w-3xl mt-8 text-neutral-800 dark:text-[#14deb9] md:text-[#262627]">Aritra/Aritra 12</b> on AoPS  if you have an account at AoPS. This is the most preferred way of submission and it is also beneficial
to participants because on AoPS PM you are allowed to send solutions one by one in that single PM, however you are not allowed so for the other two processes. But obviously you can send day 1
and day 2 separately. <br></br>

            <b className="max-w-3xl mt-8 text-neutral-800 dark:text-[#14deb9] md:text-[#262627]">Submission Process II.</b> For submitting Day I Solutions please upload solutions in the following link:
            <br></br>
            <b className="max-w-3xl mt-8 text-neutral-800 dark:text-[#14deb9] md:text-[#262627]">Submission Process III.</b> If you are unable to do any of the things above then just simply mail your
solutions pdf to us on our mail <b className="max-w-3xl mt-8 text-neutral-800 dark:text-[#14deb9] md:text-[#262627]">gaussiancurv180@gmail.com</b>

Submit you solutions through the form given in pdf below. There are other ways of submission too which you can find in the pdf.</p>
